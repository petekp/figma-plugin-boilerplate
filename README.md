# Figma plugin boilerplate

Light modification of [`create-figma-plugin`](https://github.com/yuanqing/create-figma-plugin) to streamline my personal Figma plugin projects.

Includes boilerplate for a simple UI with text input and a button, as well as common event handlers like executing the plugin, loading states, and error handling.
